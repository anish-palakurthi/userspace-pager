This project implements a userspace program loader, which is a program that loads and executes other programs without relying on the operating system's loader. The main purpose of this assignment is to understand the process of loading and executing programs at a low level, including parsing ELF headers, mapping program segments into memory, and setting up the program's stack and environment.
